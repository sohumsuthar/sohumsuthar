# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

This is a **GitHub Profile README** repository for [sohumsuthar](https://github.com/sohumsuthar). When a GitHub user creates a repository with the same name as their username and includes a `README.md`, GitHub displays the README on the user's profile page. This repo serves that purpose.

The owner is Sohum Suthar -- an Electrical Engineer, Physicist, and Lee Teng Fellow at Argonne National Laboratory. He has worked at Astera Labs and has experience across robotics, accelerator physics, AI/ML, and full-stack web development.

## Repository Structure

```
sohumsuthar/
  README.md      # The GitHub profile README (rendered on github.com/sohumsuthar)
  CLAUDE.md      # This file -- context for AI assistants
```

This is a content-only repo. There is no build system, no dependencies, no tests, and no application code. The only meaningful file is `README.md`, which is written in GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM).

## Tech Stack

- **Markdown** (GitHub-Flavored Markdown)
- **shields.io** badges for tech stack display (`https://img.shields.io/badge/...`)
- Uses a dark theme color scheme: background `#1a1b2e`, accent `#22c55e`

## Key Commands

There are no build, test, or run commands. This repo is pure static content.

```bash
# Preview the README locally (if you have a markdown previewer)
# Otherwise, push to GitHub and view at https://github.com/sohumsuthar

# Commit and push changes
git add -A && git commit -m "your message" && git push
```

## Coding Conventions

- The README uses a **terminal/CLI aesthetic**: sections are framed as shell commands (e.g., `[sohum ~]: $`)
- Badge style is `flat-square` with a consistent dark background color `1a1b2e`
- Badge logo colors match official brand colors for each technology
- The tone has evolved toward **minimal and clean** -- recent commits have progressively stripped away verbose content in favor of brevity
- Commit messages are short and descriptive, often prefixed with a type (e.g., `fix:`, `init:`, `simplify:`, `add`)

## Important Notes

- This README renders on the owner's **public GitHub profile**. Any changes are immediately visible to visitors.
- The owner has a personal website at [sohumsuthar.com](https://www.sohumsuthar.com) with a portfolio, blog posts, and resume.
- The owner's public repos span robotics (VEX AI, ROS 2, autonomous mower), scientific instrumentation (VNA SCPI, tunnel robot), web projects (portfolio, MCP servers), and academic work (differential equations).
- The commit history shows a deliberate trend toward minimalism -- the profile started detailed and has been progressively simplified. Respect this design direction when making changes.
